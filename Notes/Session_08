name: Flickerbright identified, 
description: personal herald of the white dragon, owner of the houses of respite
	ITEM: a scroll with 3 powerful seals: one of Shellan (now open), one of Erastel (bow), one of Torag (hammer), 
	QUEST: must make whole that which is broken.
		upon examination of aphra's soul, one of the seals on the scroll cracked open, revealing a page:
			Do not know how long it will be until my words are read, but I know that through actions I have taken and sins I have committed.  Truly there is no forgiveness for one such as I.  However, I must trust in the ability of man to see through this facsimile, this bond, this ritual I have created.  Know with tear stained eyes I canonize my work.  Who would say to his son that he did not love hun> what it is I have created I have come to loathe.  I hope destiny forgives my sins with my last work to unlock the ties that bind, and to unlock the chains.  I pray we are able to find an equilibrium; my last work, my redemption
			signed by Syleese Athore. Written in Bellathonis's handwriting
	ITEM: A letter of introduction to Yennik Vandomal
	ITEM: hand mirror to contact Flickerbright

given a marble from rip n tear

when examining souls, Cassius saw:
	rip n tear = two souls
	nyxsi = normal soul
	aphra = pinprick of light, was a glamour, and I can only see it because it was meant for me. soul does not fit the body; appears to be fleeting or dormant. amazingly powerful soul with fire hair and wings
	Bellathonis =  a rose in place of a soul, probably a rose of shellan


single word: "teacher" said to Aphra during the soul-scroll reading
