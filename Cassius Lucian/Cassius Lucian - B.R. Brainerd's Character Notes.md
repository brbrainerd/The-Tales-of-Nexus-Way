## Narrative Backstory

*In the perpetual twilight of Nexus Way*, where the artificial sun casts long shadows between the realms, young Cassius Lucian lives as a protected ward in the Halls of Healing. He is known only as apprentice healer, a quiet student of his craft. Beneath his carefully wrapped bandages ebbs the blood of Styromoxcies, the dragon whose influence helps maintain House Vandomal's precarious position among the great houses.

The truth of Cassius's heritage remains hidden even from Styromoxcies himself. His mother, Selenara Vale, was one of the dragon's rare human consorts, working as a soul-healer in the Halls of Healing. She kept her lineage secret, fearing that Cassius might become a target, or undermine Styromoxcies's political capital. Her fears proved well-founded when, three years ago, she became entangled in a plot by the Luminarch's zealots - religious extremists within the Lamplighter's Guild who believed that those with dragon blood could be used to enhance their control over the artificial sun.

When Cassius was eleven years old, a group of robed figures from the Luminarch's inner circle arrived with a "patient" - a soul merchant they had captured. Before Cassius's eyes, they began a ritual to forcibly extract information about dragon bloodlines from the merchant's soul. The process went horrifically wrong, and Cassius watched in horror as the merchant's soul was literally torn apart.

In that moment, Cassius learned that he could perceive souls more clearly than others - their light, their history, and their burdens. Without thinking, he reached out to try to help the merchant. This caught the attention of the zealots, who immediately recognized the potential of a child with both dragon blood and soul-mending abilities.

It was Bellathonis Iselis, who agreed to work with Selenara to hide Cassius from the zealots in exchange for information regarding his spiritual condition. In the chaos that followed, Selenara was mortally wounded, but managed to get Cassius to safety within the deepest parts of the Halls of Healing.

Before she died, she gave Cassius her most precious possession: a crystalline prism that, when held up to any light source, reveals the state of souls around him. This tool, known as the Soul's Mirror, helps him focus and control his abilities.

The Halls of Healing's Headmaster, Doctor Thaddeus Lucian, recognized both the danger and potential in Cassius's situation. He arranged for the boy to become a protected ward, officially listed in records as "Cassius Lucian," a distant cousin orphaned by tragedy. The bandages that cover much of his visible skin are explained away as the result of a fire - a story that few question in a place where many wounded live out their final days.

For the past three years, Cassius has lived and worked in the Halls, slowly learning to control his abilities while hiding in plain sight. His official role as an apprentice healer allows him to help others without drawing suspicion, though he must be careful to mask his soul-mending abilities as more conventional healing techniques. The Halls themselves, with their maze-like corridors and centuries of accumulated magical protections, serve as both home and fortress.

Doctor Thaddeus Lucian knows the truth, as does Bellathonis, though they rarely speak of it directly. The connection forged that night has remained, with Bellathonis occasionally visiting the Halls, to utilize the scholastic access he has been granted. These visits allow him to check on Cassius, whose secrets and gratitude he may potentially leverage.

Despite the trauma of his past, Cassius maintains a surprising optimism. Working with damaged souls has instilled him with wisdom beyond his years, and each small victory - each patient helped, each passing soothed - reinforces his hope.

The zealots never stopped searching, though their attention has been divided. Led by Sister Moira, a faction within the Luminarch's inner circle believes that combining dragon blood with soul magic could create a direct connection to the artificial sun itself. Towards that end, she has begun to hoard captured souls in artificial crystals. Their occasional presence in the Halls, under the guise of charity, keeps Cassius constantly alert.

Recently, the political stirrings in Nexus Way have begun to affect even the relative safety of the Halls. The restoration of House Vandomal's monopoly, the presence of three senior dragons at council meetings, and whispers about the Lamplighter's true identity have brought increased scrutiny to all corners of the city. Cassius has begun to realize that he cannot hide in the Halls forever, especially as his abilities continue to grow.

The recent events involving House Vandomal and the various soul-related mysteries in the city have not gone unnoticed by Cassius. The presence of Aphra, who appears to lack a soul entirely, particularly intrigues him, though he's kept his observations to himself.

His daily routine involves legitimate healing work with patients suffering from conventional ailments, while secretly using his soul-sensing abilities to identify those who might need more specialized help. The Soul's Mirror helps him maintain control, and on particularly difficult nights, he retreats to his hidden alcove in the Halls' garden, where the artificial sunlight creates patterns through his mother's prism that remind him of happier times.

## Personality Traits

*From the private journals of Cassius Lucian:*

> "Kindness and competence can be a scalpel in the hands of the right surgeon. I live surrounded by priests, whispering honey-dipped words while their spirits scream of sulferous corruption. When they look at me, they see a child--naive, easily cowed. Perhaps I am. But no more. Publicly, I war with them through immaculate procedure. Privately, I plan to depart."

> "Mother taught me that vulnerability is not the same as weakness. I choose carefully when to let down my guard, when to let others see the boy beneath the bandages. In the past, this has helped patients trust in their healing, but it has also warded away those who think only in terms of personal gain."

> "I find comfort in precision - in the terminology of the healing arts, and in carefully coded notes about the tableau of souls. Doctor Lucian says I process my feelings like an alchemist concocts a tincture: carefully, and in measured doses. When you have witnessed proof against the lie of the immortality of souls, and when you yourself live behind a veil of necessary lies...sometimes the only way to know what is right is to treat the man in front of you."

> "The Mirror helps. Through its prism, everything becomes clearer. Mother would say that I am too young to yearn for an earlier time, but in Nexus Way, survival often means growing up faster than the artificial sun can set."
